In this chapter, we will introduce AI and chatbots and their role in transforming the hiring process.

What is AI?
-----------

AI stands for artificial intelligence. It involves creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI can be divided into two categories: narrow or general AI.

Narrow AI refers to AI systems that are designed to perform a specific task, such as playing chess or recognizing faces. General AI refers to AI systems that can perform any intellectual task that a human can do.

What are Chatbots?
------------------

Chatbots are computer programs that use natural language processing (NLP) to simulate conversation with human users. They can be programmed to understand and respond to user inquiries, providing real-time assistance and support.

Chatbots can be used in a variety of industries, including customer service, healthcare, and education. In recruitment, chatbots can automate repetitive tasks, provide personalized recommendations, and collect data on candidate behavior and preferences.

Overall, AI and chatbots have the potential to revolutionize the recruitment industry, creating more efficient, effective, and inclusive hiring processes that meet the needs and preferences of both job seekers and employers.
